# Servlet Examples

This repository was created to make myself comfortable with the technologies that were required for my [Google Summe of Code 2020 project (GSOC)](https://gist.github.com/a-rekkusu/b98ecd201d25102ca3e118a2fa38fbb4).
It covers samples for using Meecrowave, Netty, OpenWebBeans (OWB), Tomcat Servlets and TomEE with CDI in the respectively named sub-modules.
